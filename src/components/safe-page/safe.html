        <div class="default-text">You see this page because the site you tried to visit is blocked by the extension.
            <br><br> Never think, "I'll just check porn quickly but I won't go further." Even watching it makes you more
            vulnerable to temptation. Lust challenges your spiritual strength and weakens your resolve.

            Even though it feels pleasurable now, afterward you'll probably regret it — otherwise you wouldn't have
            installed this extension. Why bother at all? Instead, write down why you chose to resist lust and how you
            felt the last time you gave in. Use the Safe Page to reflect on these thoughts later and stay motivated.

            If you feel an urge to watch porn or masturbate, just wait. Urges always fade — whether in minutes, hours,
            or days, they vanish. Don't let anyone or anything seduce you. Think: "Yes, it feels pleasurable now, but I
            can let go of this short-term desire and be happier, healthier, and stronger in the long run."

            Learn to withstand lust and fleeting pleasure. Not everything that feels good is truly good. Tell yourself:
            "Despite the urges I feel now, I simply don't need that. No matter what benefits it seems to have, I choose
            not to. I don't care if I lose anything."

            The power is always inside you. Lust may feel pleasurable not because it has power over you, but because you
            are sensing your own power projected outward. That's why after giving in you feel worse and unmotivated —
            because you've given away your own power. Even if you struggle, remember: you are not alone."
